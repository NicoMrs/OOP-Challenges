    "- Create a letter guessing game for the English alphabet\n",
    "- Initially, the computer picks a letter; then, the user is repeatedly given opportunities to guess that letter\n",
    "- The performance of the user is tracked. Specifically:\n",
    "    - the overall time taken to arrive at an accurate guess, and\n",
    "    - the number of valid guesses that came before what the computer guess, and\n",
    "    - the number of valid guesses that came after\n",
    "- Internally, try to have the application use a custom exception hierarchy to refine the handling of the game flow.\n",
    "  In other words, try to have the game control flow incorporate custom exceptions that match the problem domain\n",
    "  (e.g. before letter, after letter, not a letter, etc)\n",
    "- In the end end the user gets a summary of how long it took to correctly guess as well how many before/after guesses\n",
    "  were made\n",
    "- If the game is interrupted halfway through (hint: KeyboardInterrupt), the user still gets the summary of the\n",
